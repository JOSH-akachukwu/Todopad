Finish my todo app, well I call it *Todo pad* now.
Make Todo pad into a fully functional simple tool (with more features).
In order to become a good C programmer I need to first take a bath in the fundamentals first (be aware but not priorities on system specifics).
Show a better level of self discipline to my SELF.
I need to stop wasting away my resources.
Currently Todopad has no Bugs.
A steady hand does the best.
