This project is a simple tool that I hope to integrate into my OS of which I have plans on building ( it proberbly going to be open source ).
Right now it's just a simple CLI tool quite cool and aslo, quite not so cool. Lots of features need to be implemented in order to bring out the full potential of Todo pad.

Currently it can :
- > Add todos (tasks).
- > Remove todos.
- > Edit existing todos.
- > Save and read todos from files (it caches todos into memory then saves to file on exit, or maybe not!).

TODOS :
- > Reminder.
- > Undo last action.
- > Set priorities and due date.
- > Mark todos as completed.
- > Search and filter todos by key word.
- > Bulk actions { "Remove all", "Mark all", etc }.
- > Better file formats to support the long term storage of todos and support for the aforementioned features.
- > May be add some colourful output.
- > command line args.

I also need a way of clearing the stdin before reprinting todo. Right now it just prints on creating a croll on the CLI window.
I don't know why, but conio.h doesn't really work on my machine or something ( or may be I haven't made adequate researches on how to use it ?).

Then the big finish - > Adding a GUI.
